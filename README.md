# logistic_regression_handwritten_dig_recog
I have attempted the identification og handwritten digits using logistic regression,from scratch.
Used one vs all algorith for multiple logistic regression.
Trained 10 separate classifier for each digit.
Achieved an accuracy of aroun 99.4% for the final classifier.
